# P2PChat
P2PChat is a terminal based peer to peer chat application written purely in Java as of now.
Additional improvements to the user experience need the use of a native library
`ncurses`, which will be added later.

Currently, P2PChat uses Java's networking library to create and utilise sockets
to communicate with peers.

I have some other improvements lined up, like getting the name of the peer automatically over the network, rather than having to type it.
I will add those later.
